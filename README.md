# django-holidays
Django app with configurable rules for holidays

A few apps can be found online to calculate public holidays but;
* some use models with fixed dates
* some use calculation rules (no models, not django app)

This one allows the setup of the rules to calculate holiday dates through django_admin

Rule-design based on https://github.com/novapost/workalendar
